## v1.0.2 - Jira Automation Copy Polish

Structured doc copy clarifies configure/createIssue usage so Jira automation readers keep REST API keywords in view and know where to look for the latest references. Updated the helper header and examples to mention the latest dependency aliases so the sample flows feel up-to-date.

### Changed
- Tightened README/docs copy to emphasize Jira automations and platform links, keeping the configure/createIssue terminology prominent.
- Reworked configure, transitionIssue, and addComment examples (both in the docs and the module header) to use expanded formatting and point readers to the latest helper dependencies and call structure.

## v1.0.1 - Jira Cloud Issue Helper Release

Jira module release preps packaging for the Jira Cloud issue helper. The entry highlights configure, createIssue, transitionIssue, and addComment flows for REST API v3 so the keywords stay visible.

### Added
- Jira Cloud helper exposes configure, createIssue, transitionIssue, and addComment functions that cover authentication and common issue-management REST API calls.
